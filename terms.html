            Last updated: 24 November 2025
        </p>

        <p>
            These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the Dear Diary Android application (“Dear Diary”,
            “app”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By downloading, installing, or using Dear Diary, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
            If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the app.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Use of the app</h2>
        <p>
            Dear Diary is provided for personal, non-commercial use as a private journaling and note-taking tool.
            You agree to use the app in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The content you create, store, or otherwise make available through Dear Diary.</li>
            <li>Maintaining the security of your device, including any lock screen, biometric settings, or system updates.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that you have appropriate backups of your data if you choose to export or copy it elsewhere (outside of the app).</li>
            <li>Using the app in a lawful manner and not using it to store or share illegal content.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            You agree not to use Dear Diary to store or facilitate content that is unlawful, abusive, defamatory, harassing,
            fraudulent, or otherwise objectionable under applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Local-only data and no backups</h2>
        <p>
            Dear Diary is designed as a local-only application:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All diary entries, attachments, and settings are stored on your device.</li>
            <li>We do not operate servers and do not provide cloud backup.</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your diary content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Because we do not store your data on our servers, we cannot recover lost or deleted entries,
            attachments, or settings. If you lose your device, uninstall the app, clear app data, or experience device failure,
            your data may be permanently lost. You are solely responsible for maintaining any backups or exports outside the app,
            if you choose to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Content ownership</h2>
        <p>
            You retain full ownership of any content you create or store in Dear Diary, including text, photos, videos, audio,
            and other attachments (“User Content”).
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not claim any ownership rights over your User Content, and we do not access, transmit, or sell your User Content,
            as it remains on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Use of device hardware and permissions</h2>
        <p>
            Dear Diary may request access to certain device features and permissions in order to provide specific functionalities,
            including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To allow you to capture photos or videos and attach them to entries.</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To allow you to record audio notes and attach them to entries, or use optional narration features where applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage / Files:</strong> To allow you to select existing photos, videos, audio recordings, or other documents to attach to entries.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send optional journaling reminders if you enable them.</li>
            <li><strong>Biometric / Device credentials:</strong> To secure access to the app with your device’s biometric or lock-screen protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These permissions are used only for the purpose of providing the described features and only when you initiate the relevant action (such as attaching media or enabling biometric unlock). You can manage and revoke these permissions through your device settings at any time. However, revoking certain permissions may limit or disable related features in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Limitations of liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Dear Diary and its developer(s) shall not be liable for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any loss of data, including diary entries, attachments, or configuration settings.</li>
            <li>Any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the app.</li>
            <li>Any damages resulting from unauthorized access to your device or your failure to secure your device properly.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with Dear Diary is to stop using the app and uninstall it from your device.
        </p>

        <h2>7. No warranty</h2>
        <p>
            Dear Diary is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranties of any kind, either express or implied.
            We do not warrant that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The app will be error-free or uninterrupted.</li>
            <li>Defects will be corrected.</li>
            <li>The app will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Updates and modifications</h2>
        <p>
            We may update or modify Dear Diary from time to time, including adding or removing features, fixing bugs, or improving performance.
            Updates may be delivered via the app store where you downloaded the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also reserve the right to modify these Terms. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this document.
            Your continued use of Dear Diary after any changes to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>
            You may stop using Dear Diary at any time by uninstalling the app from your device.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may, at our sole discretion, discontinue Dear Diary, stop offering the app through app stores, or limit access to certain devices or regions.
            Because Dear Diary does not rely on user accounts, we do not “suspend” or “delete” accounts; however, discontinuation of the app may prevent further use or updates.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Governing law</h2>
        <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the developer is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
            If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
        </p>
